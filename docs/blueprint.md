- Core Message Presentation: A series of informative screens that present the core message using videos, animations, and clear text overlays, using realistic example images from Newtown Borough.
- Interactive Tips: Tap-to-reveal cards with simple facts and tips on reducing household waste, each with its own playful background pattern.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A friendly green (#8FBC8F) to invoke environmental awareness and Newtown Borough itself.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to ensure content stands out. Same hue as the primary, but much lighter and desaturated.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#E9967A) for CTAs and interactive elements; a warmer color in order to ensure separation.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet approachable and legible feel on mobile.
- Use custom icons representing different waste types and recycling symbols for a visual guide.
- Mobile-first vertical layout optimized for one-handed use. Each screen should focus on a single idea or interaction.
- Use animations for micro-interactions like correct/incorrect answers, drag-and-drop feedback, and progress tracking.
